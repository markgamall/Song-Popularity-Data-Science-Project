# Song-Popularity-Data-Science-Project
The objective of our project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the popularity of songs on Spotify. To achieve this, we will leverage a comprehensive dataset containing various features related to each song. These features encompass details such as song attributes, information, and specific metrics from the Hot 100 chart.
