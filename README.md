# Song Popularity Prediction

# Project Overview
The objective of our project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast the popularity of songs on Spotify. To achieve this, we will leverage a comprehensive dataset containing various features related to each song. These features encompass details such as song attributes, information, and specific metrics from the Hot 100 chart.

The project involved intensive EDA and data analysis to understand the dataset thoroughly. Various feature engineering techniques were employed, including encoding, scaling, transformations, outlier handling, and the creation of new features. Extensive preprocessing ensured data integrity by addressing nulls and not real data.
Model selection was conducted utilizing automated hyperparameter tuning to enhance performance. A thorough evaluation process led to the identification of the best model.
